# React Fundamentals Intro

In this blog, we will learn about the fundamentals of react like:

1. Website vs Web application
    
2. SPA (Single Page Application)
    
3. Components
    
4. Declarative
    

So let's start,

Website vs Web app

The lines between these two are very thin sometimes that's why we need to categorize them.

* Website
    
    Website is like presenting Products or services.
    
    For example:
    

1. Blogs
    
2. Portfolio's
    
3. Landing pages.
    

* Web app
    
    Whereas a web app is a software running in the browser.
    
    For example:
    

1. Instagram
    
2. Google
    
3. Twitter.
    

SPA (Single Page Application)

* The Dynamic update of the current web page takes place (with data from a server) instead of loading entire new pages.
    
* It has faster transitions and feels more like a native app that is downloaded into our system.
    

Components

* Components are like small building blocks that make up a react app.
    
* They are independent and reusable bits of code.
    
* It helps in maintaining a react app such as in refactoring, bug fixes, testing etc.

Now react is declarative,

Declarative vs imperative

It's like telling what to do instead of telling how to do it.

let's build a situation like "I want a dessert after dinner".

so in declarative:

**React**: "*Here's your dessert*".

whereas in imperative it commands like

* Go to the kitchen.
    
* Open the fridge.
    
* Take out the dessert.
    
* Serve it in a bowl.
    
* Serve the bowl.
    

This was all about the fundamental and brief intro about react in the next part of this series we will go further and deep dive into react.

so do follow!! Peace.
