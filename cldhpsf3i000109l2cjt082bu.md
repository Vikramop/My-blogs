# Wrap up of 2022: My blockchain journey

### Introduction: About me

Hi there, I'm Vikram, B.E final year student from tier 3 college.

And I've done something productive in 2022 which I'm a little proud of and will share in the blog below.

Hope you guys find it interesting.

p.s - This is my first blog so plz ignore any mistakes. let's go.

BTW find the short version of this on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ItsveerZ/status/1617084858693750784?s=20&t=1PPMQRPB6Dt3LNOawyOK3A).

### How I entered into the blockchain.

After winning the hackathon in Dec 2021, so I decided to jump into DevOps in 2022.

I remembered the first video of saiyam's about the roadmap of DevOps, so I started.

Done with the Linux foundation course, then I started the microservices and Kubernetes I got stuck in the security part so I started digging youtube after lots of searches I got a security system in blockchain that's how I got diverted into the blockchain.

### Learning about blockchain technologyü§ê.

Then started deep digging for this technology. After a week of digging, I started learning the language solidity and after gaining some basic knowledge I made my first [Project](https://github.com/Vikramop/Booking-app-backend-with-solidity) using this language. As I was having basic knowledge of javascript so I planned to make full-stack blockchain apps, But nothing goes as planned.

I needed to learn how blockchain works in the backend i.e. how it runs where it runs.

After learning that I go stuck on how to connect my front end to the back end.

### Learning more stuff.

Now I started butchering all the tutorials for learning how to solve my problem and also I visit my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ItsveerZ) very often, once scrolling I found a tweet about the guy completing the challenges of web3 I click immediately and that was the best thing that happened cuz I got to know about this community which has recently launched their web3 course for free which not only solves my problem but also teach the essential knowledge used in web3. [LearnWeb3](https://learnweb3.io/courses) üòéis the best community to learn web3 from scratch.

Then I started with the courses and completed all the levels, If now I get any errors or problems I immediately switched to the discord of LearnWeb3 and got my problem solved and also solve the problems of others.

### Projects phaseü§©.

Now I got much more familiar with web3 so started to do projects and I was enjoying doing so that in 2-3 months my GitHub was having more greenery than my whole lifeüòÅ.
